## About the Project
This project is the fourth homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I was asked to create a timed quiz for a coding student. I was given a set of acceptance criteria, as well as a gif of an example quiz (included below). I was asked to have a similar functionality to the example, but was able to create my own style and rules for the quiz.

### JavaScript
This assignment was my second using JavaScript. Through this assignment, I was able to delve much deeper into the language and learn about different aspects.

#### Objects and Arrays
While I have used arrays in the past, this week was my first exploration of objects. Within objects you are able to store multiple key and value pairs. For instance, in this case I was able to store a question, all of the answer options, and the correct answer within one object. Additionally, I was able to store objects inside of arrays. So all of my question objects were stored in one collective array. I was then able to access the array as a whole, a question object as a whole, or a value within an object.

#### Functions
While I did create a function for last week’s assignment, this week required many functions. I learned a lot about how functions work together. Additionally, this assignment helped to reinforce the concept of variable scope. I learned quickly that variables created within functions would not be available outside of that sphere.

#### Events
There were several things that required event listeners in this assignment. Events are changes or actions on a page such as a click, scrolling, or even resizing the window. JavaScript allows us to listen for these events, and trigger functions with them. For instance, I was able to listen for click events on the quiz’s start button which triggered the quiz to launch.

#### DOM Manipulation 
The Document Object Model, or DOM, is a model which treats the HTML document like an object. Through this model you can access and change various aspects of the HTML in JavaScript. You can access elements, or their relative elements such as child or parent elements. You can manipulate these through changing things like the style, the text content, or attributes. I used this model to hide or show elements by accessing their class attributes and adding or removing the “hidden” class. Additionally I used the Document Object Model to create elements, change their text content and styling, and append them to the document (such as appending all of the high scores). 

## Benefits of This Project
This week I was able to develop my understanding of what is possible with JavaScript. I was given practice in my understanding of objects. This helped to solidify the methods that are used to access information within an object (especially when that object is within an array). I was also able to develop my skills in creating functions. I learned a lot about different methods for changing the HTML document and traversing the DOM. Finally, I was able to advance my skills in tracking down solutions. There were so many parts to the project, and there was no way for me to have memorized everything I would need. A lot of this project was looking back through past class activities, watching videos, and Googling. With the amount of coding information that is available online, this is a very useful skill to have.
